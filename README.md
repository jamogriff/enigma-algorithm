## Enigma

Enigma is a Ruby program that can encrypt, decrypt and crack text files. It was written to conform to the interaction pattern found at [the Turing backend site](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/enigma/index).

### Design
The class topography can be viewed below. Of note is the `User` class, where the user can select one of two languages to run the program in (Spanish and English).

### Self-Evaluation
In terms of self-evaluating this project according to [this rubric](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/enigma/rubric), I believe the highest score of 4 is deserved in terms of Object-Oriented Design, Ruby Conventions and Mechanics, Functionality and Version Control. In terms of Test-Driven design, I belive I may be between a 3 and a 4. All of my methods (including helper methods) have been thoroughly tested with 99% coverage, so that may go either way.
